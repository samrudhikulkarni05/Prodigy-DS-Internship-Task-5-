Welcome to my submission for Task 5 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I analyzed traffic accident data to discover patterns based on weather, road conditions, and time-related factors, aiming to highlight accident hotspots and causes.

# Dataset
The dataset used is from a Kaggle Notebook on U.S. Accident EDA, which contains detailed accident records across the United States including factors such as location, weather, time, and severity.

Tools and Libraries Used

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, Numpy

Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization

Folium for interactive map plotting

Accident Data Analysis Process

# The key steps followed during this analysis include:

Data Cleaning: Removed missing or irrelevant records, standardized datetime and location formats.

Pattern Identification: Explored accident frequency by time of day, weather conditions, and road surface types.

Visualization: Created heatmaps and time series plots to highlight high-risk areas and peak accident hours.

Hotspot Mapping: Used geospatial mapping to visualize accident density and hotspots in urban vs rural areas.


# Conclusion

This analysis revealed critical insights, such as higher accident rates during peak hours, poor weather impact, and specific locations more prone to incidents. These findings can assist city planners, traffic control authorities, and policymakers in improving road safety.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
